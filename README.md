# Fruitcake proof of concept: responsive button grid with SVG overlay

This is a simple proof of concept for using an SVG mask overlaying a grid of buttons.

It is using the soft-light mix blend mode (known from Photoshop) on the overlay, 70% opacity. The overlay is ignoring pointer events so that the buttons below function as normal.
